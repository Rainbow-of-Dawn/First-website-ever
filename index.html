      <h4>Our Heroes' background</h4>
      <div class="flex-container">
        <div>
          <p>Captain Garnet was born on a ship in the sea of Marmara.</p>
          <p>Her father, the infamous pirate Captain Cutlass,<br> trained her to become an elite strategist, trader and fighter.</p> 
          <p>She quickly became the Quartermaster of her father's ship,<br> and earned the name Garnet because of her red hair.</p>
          <p>They sailed off the Mediterranean Sea together, even till Egypt.</p>
          <p>During a cannon attack ambush near the Nile,<br>their ship got boarded by enemies.</p>
          <p>An infiltrated spy of King Aeetes shielded her from harm,<br>but Captain Cutlass got fatally wounded by the cannons.</p>
          <p>At her father's death, the crew designated her to be the new Captain.</p>
          <p>Since then, she and King Aeetes's infiltrated spy became lovers.</p>
          <p>Captain Garnet's network and reputation grew even overseas.</p>
          <p>Renowned for being fearless and respected by many,<br> she can defeat and pillage several ships per day.</p>
          <p>Thankful towards King Aeetes for having saved her life,<br>she has decided to dedicate her life to serving the interests of Colchis.</p>
          <p>With dozens of ships under her command, she is the pair of eyes,<br>ears and hands of the Kingdom over the Black Sea.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Raised as a Knight of Colchis, Lord Ebony came from a wealthy family.</p>
          <p>He is a specialist of nobility, negotiation and war.</p>
          <p>Lord Ebony knows every noble family of the country,<br> which gives him a huge political influence and power.</p>
          <p>Agile and clever, he is the finest strategist of the Kingdom,<br>hence why he coordinates the Colchis Army with our General.</p>
          <p>His loyalty to King Aeetes is without equal.</p>
          <p>Lord Ebony's fighting skills are just as excellent, above all with swords.</p>
          <p>His father owns a castle in the North East forest,<br>this is where he met Lady Chartreuse.</p>
          <p>The two became engaged, and King Aeetes supports their union,<br>which helps fighting off social class discrimination.</p>
          <p>Lord Ebony and his allies helped the Kingdom win the battle of Cape Jason,<br>South West of Colchis, where his courage and skills came to light.</p>
          <p>He regularly trains young recruits in our Army, and he takes care of the elder,<br>particularly our war veterans, by funding care programs for their cause.</p>
          <p>Everyday, Lord Ebony fights for Colchis, whether it be with good deeds,<br>like giving to local charities, or by leading sentinel and patrol operations.</p>

          <p>Lady Chartreuse's ancestry fled from war and sought refuge in Colchis.</p>
          <p>She grew up in poverty. Her family raised her in a small hut,<br>in the heart of the North East forest.</p>
          <p>Everything they could get mattered. They hunted their own food.</p>
          <p>She was also taught how to use plants as food, medicine and poison.</p>
          <p>One day during a hunt, Lady Chartreuse met Lord Ebony,<br>they became inseparable since then.</p>
          <p>None in the Kingdom of Colchis is better with bows and arrows than her.</p>
          <p>During the lastest Olympic Games of Greece in Olympus,<br> she was granted the gold medal of archery.</p>
          <p>Master hunter and survival expert, she is a precious ally to Colchis.</p>
          <p>She has become the National Archery Champion of the Kingdom.</p>
          <p>This is how she earned her title of "Lady of the Kingdom".</p>
          <p>The opening of the Faculty of Medicine was celebrated with her presence,<br>notably by making a register of all medicinal plants of the Kingdom.</p>
          <p>She also brought her contribution to the Colchis School of Archery,<br> where she teaches as an Emerit Profesor.</p>
