# First-website-ever

**Build status:** completed



### Why:

The website was made as part of a tech challenge to pass the selection tests of a programming school.

Since it met all the requirements and I successfully solved all of their other tech challenge exercises, I did pass the selection tests of the school.


### How

I used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

At the time of this project, I was completely new to web development. The school had provided me with pre-tech challenge courses. I built up the entire website from scratch.


### What

The general theme is golden to represent the wealth depicted in the legend of the Kingdom of Colchis.

The whole set of characters' stories and sporting events is fictional and was invented based on my personal research of the Greek Mythology about Colchis.

For more realism, real life ancient geographical maps and information were used, notably to find the Sea of Marmara and Cape Jason.


### Tech challenge instructions

The school had both mandatory instructions and optional ones. I respected all of them and went beyond by adding a hover effect on the Sporting Events table rows.

The provided wireframes were only a guide.

The mandatory instructions included:
* a home page comprised of a welcome section displaying a message with a picture and then heroes 
* a royal family page with portraits of the royals horizontally side by side in a flexbox container
* a sporting events page with a table
* a contact page

The optional instructions suggested having:
* an imported Google font, I chose Roboto Slab as you can see on my index.html page
* a JavaScript pop up message appearing upon submitting a contact form


### Copyrights

The website is entirely made of royalty free images and content.

The royal family portraits and full bodies were made using the free character creator online tool which can be found at https://charactercreator.org/
