      <h1>The Royal Family's background</h1>
      <p>The dynasty of the Royal Family of Colchis dates back to the beginnings of the Greek era.</p>
      <p>The location of the Kingdom being at the crossroads between Asia and Europe,<br>the wisdom of the King and Queen insurances peace and safety to all of its citizens.</p>
      <p>King Aeetes led several wars and won thanks to his mighty Army and strong allies,<br>such as our local Heroes, our General and Commanders.</p>
      <p>Art and nature lovers, the Royal Family has been funding many different programs across the country,<br>including about preserving our forests and national reserves.</p>
      <p>The Kingdom being influential and its territory being huge,<br>it is natural to the Queen and Princess to also give to important charities fighting off hunger and poverty.</p>
      <p>Several orphenages have recently opened across the country, as well as shelters for the needy.</p>
